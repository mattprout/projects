## Ford GoBike Share Analysis
In this project, I performed an analysis on the Ford GoBike share program in San Francisco, with the aim to increase ridership.  The data can be found here:
https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/bay-bike-share

I used BigQuery to query the ridership data and gain insights into ridership by different types of users and routes, and presented the results in a [Jupyter notebook](./FordGoBikeShare.ipynb).

Based on the insights from the data, I provided specific recommendations to increase ridership, such as:

* Having an online ad campaign to convert non-subscribing commuters on the most popular commuter routes.
* Investigating a different pricing model for tourists/casual riders.
* Provide an off-season price reduction for non-subscriber rentals.
