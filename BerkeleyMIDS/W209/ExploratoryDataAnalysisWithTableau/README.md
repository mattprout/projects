## Exploratory Data Analysis using Tableau

The purpose of this [assignment](ExploratoryDataAnalysisUsingTableau.pdf) was to find evidence for or against three hypotheses we came up with for a particular data set by performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a data set in order using Tableau.

The data set I chose came from the Online Dating & Relationships survey from the Pew Research Center (http://www.pewinternet.org/2013/10/21/online-dating-relationships/).

The hypotheses I came up with were:
1.	Online daters have limited success (less than 50%) at finding a partner.
2.	People who use online dating to find a partner are less likely to have children.
3.	People in both urban and rural environments use online dating at the same rate.

The data set required some cleaning and additional fields to be added.  This was done in R.
